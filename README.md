# Purplane
i wanted to use Purpur and Airplane but it didn't exist so i made one...

btw if you want config stuff look at [purpur](https://pl3xgaming.github.io/PurpurDocs) or airplane docs

also people told me this was dumb and stuff so um... dont use it idk **i wont give support**
and also if you want my opinion on the best fork its purpur
